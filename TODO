TODO
~~~~
* Reimplement layer architecture
  * Restructure directory tree (programs/gaia -> src/,
    programs/others -> util/, gaia layers -> layers/)
  * Create simple libgaia which provides layer interface
  * Create test layer working with libgaia, disable all other
    layers for now
  * Add config class with configfile reading/writing and easy
    access to tree-like structure. Implement basic types handling
    (int/string/bool)
    * Should gracefully process structure changes (automatically
      add newly added keys to config)
    * Should leave comments
    * Should strip default values from config (or comment them out)
    * Should be able to modify config from commandline to some extent
      (but I guess such changes should not be saved). I.e.
      gaia --enable-layer=GPS --gps-enable-all-sources
  * Review/refactor some support structures
    * Threadsafe log with mutexes
    * Timer
  * Reimplement tile rendering routine to allow non-rectangular
    tiles
  * Create ExampleLayer. This will server as both example/template
    for new layer creators and as unittest for all layer interfaces.
  * Implement Qt dialogs in ExampleLayer
    * Implement sidebar dialog
    * Implement standalone dialog
    * Make all those interact with config class
    * Make all this Qt-related stuff conditionally compiled
  * Implement services for icon/text/hud drawing
    * As far as I remember icon stuff is already present to some
      extent
    * Add text handling. Freetype? Xft? sdl_ttf?
* Next, adapt existing layers to new order 
  * WorldWind
  * Grid
* Next, see TODO.OLD
  * Possibly it'll be good to release something at this moment, or
    should other features be added before?

Random stuff:
* Use forward declarations for faster compilation
