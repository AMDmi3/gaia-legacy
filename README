           gaia - opensource 3D interface to the planet
          ==============================================

Command line arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-w, --world=MODEL
    Select world model. Default model is `flat', which gives you
    simple flat world view, similar to plain paper map. No rotation
    or tilt, but this model is fastest. Another model currently
    available is `3d', which will show you earth as a globe with
    extended navigation functions. It's currently not finished, so
    not much of use.

-m, --master=TYPE
    Select master layer. Master layer determines where earth data
    comes from and how it's shown. Default master layer is `worldwind',
    which needs no explanation. Another layer is `test' used
    primarily for testing other components.

-t, --test
    Add test slave layer. Used for testing like test master layer.

-g, --grid
    Add grid slave layer. Shows dynamic geographical grid (not
    fully functional currently).

-p, --gps=SOURCE
    Add GPS slave layer. Shows location of GPS device and it's route.
    Available sources are:

    gpsd://host[:port] - Connect to gpsd running on specified host
    and port. Port is optional and defaults to 2947. Gpsd supports
    many GPS devices and may be run locally or remotely. For details,
    see http://gpsd.berlios.de/

    nmea://path - Path to device (socket/fifo also works) that outputs
    NMEA information from GPS device.

    test:// - Provides fake coordinates for layer testing.

Building & Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To build gaia, you need:
    - SCons (http://www.scons.org)
    - cURL library (http://curl.haxx.se)
    - SDL library (http://www.libsdl.org)
    - jpeg library (http://www.ijg.org)
    - png library (http://libpng.sourceforge.net)
    - libgps (http://gpsd.berlios.de) - optional

Once you obtain all of these, just run in this directory:

% scons

This will build gaia and produce binar(y/ies) runnable from current
directory.

If you want systemwide installation of gaia, you should explicitly
provide prefix and specify install target:

% scons prefix=/usr/local install

This will build gaia and install binaries into /usr/local/bin/ and
data files into /usr/local/share/gaia/. You can change path suffixes:

% scons prefix=/usr/local bindir=bin/gaia datadir=data/gaia install

Now, binaries will be installed into /usr/local/bin/gaia/ and data
files into /usr/local/data/gaia/
