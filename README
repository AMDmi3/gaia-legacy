           gaia - opensource 3D interface to the planet
          ==============================================

Command line arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-w, --world=MODEL
    Select world model. Default model is `flat', which gives you
    simple flat world view, similar to plain paper map. No rotation
    or tilt, but this model is fastest. Another model currently
    available is `3d', which will show you earth as a globe with
    extended navigation functions. It's currently not finished, so
    not much of use.

-t, --test
    Add test layer. Used for rendering testing.

-g, --grid
    Add grid layer. Shows dynamic geographical grid (not fully
    functional currently).

-p, --gps=SOURCE
    Add GPS layer. Shows location of GPS device and it's route.
    Available sources are:

    gpsd://host[:port] - Connect to gpsd running on specified host
    and port. Port is optional and defaults to 2947. Gpsd supports
    many GPS devices and may be run locally or remotely. For details,
    see http://gpsd.berlios.de/

    nmea://path - Path to device (socket/fifo also works) that outputs
    NMEA information from GPS device.

    test:// - Provides fake coordinates for layer testing.

Building & Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To build gaia, you need:
    - cmake (http://www.cmake.org)
    - Qt3 (http://www.trolltech.com)
    - libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl)
    - libjpeg (http://www.ijg.org)
    - libpng (http://libpng.sourceforge.net)
    - libgps (http://gpsd.berlios.de) - optional

Once you obtain all of these, just run in this directory:

% cmake .
or, if you want libgps support,
% cmake -DWITH_GPSD=1 .

Then just run

% make

After the build process is complete, run gaia with

% programs/gaia/gaia
